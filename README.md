    <h1>Blacket Bot</h1>
    <h3>the fan-made open-sourced blacket bot.</h3>
</div>
<br>
<br>

I've released the code to this bot in the hopes that people can learn from it.<br>
In [main.js](./main.js#L5), on line 5, it imports a package used for Confidence to connect to the Blacket API.<br>
This package is not open-source or bundled in with this library. This entire bot is not meant to be cloned and used.<br>
<br>
If you do decide to use some code, just add a small `footer.text` in the `/help` command with my name :)<br>
